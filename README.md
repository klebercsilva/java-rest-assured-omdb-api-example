## java-rest-assured-omdb-api-example
 The purpose of this sample project is to demonstrate the implementation of a testing framework using [Java] (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase), [RestAssured] (http://rest-assured.io/), [Cucumber] (https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm) and [TestNG] (http://testng.org/doc/). This is only possible thanks to the free [OMDb API] (http://www.omdbapi.com/) which provides a large amount of data, including: movies, series and even episodes. It's worth mentioning there is currently a limit of 1000/calls/day.
